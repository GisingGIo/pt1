         <div class="et">  GOOD DAY! We are students from 8 - Pearl, Special Program in Journalism (SPJ), and here is our light introduction to our beloved page. </div>
          <div class="et"> We were tasked to create a survey form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the capability to store data locally through our device. The questions in our said survey form shall be based on our preferences. The Survey Form will then be completed by a different group during the next computer science subject meeting in class.  </div>
        <div class="et">  As the activity is performed in pairs, both of us decided to split the parts of the performance task in order to sufficiently create an interactive survey form with additional design to please our target audience and achieve the highest possible score. We started by planing out the main base layout of our website by exchanging opinions, then we proceeded to agree on a certain design in which we executed perfectly.</div>
          <div class="et">  Then we browsed our options about how we can get a diverse approach in order to make our survey unique.   </div>
